# Titanic Survival Analysis ðŸš¢

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project based on the Titanic dataset. Using Python libraries, we explore passenger demographics and survival outcomes, and build predictive models to understand the factors influencing survival.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values for `Age` and `Embarked` columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to uncover survival patterns across different passenger classes, ages, and genders.
- **Machine Learning**: Built a predictive model using Random Forest to classify survival with accuracy metrics.
- **Tools Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.

Dataset
The dataset is included in this repository as titanic.csv. It contains 891 records of Titanic passengers, including features such as:

Passenger demographics (Age, Gender, etc.)
Ticket information
Survival outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Results
Our model achieved  accuracy  on the test set. The notebook contains detailed performance metrics.
